<h2>Google Play Services for Titanium</h2>

The goal of this repo is to help catalog and provide tooling support for the versions of Google Play Servies used by different modules in Titanium.

<h2>By Module</h2>

<h3>Ti.Map</h3>
You can find the versions of Google Play packaged with the Ti.Map module organized by version at  [https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.Map](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.Map)

<h3>Ti.GA</h3>
You can find the versions of Google Play packaged with the Ti.GA module organized by version at  [https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.GA](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/Ti.GA)

<h3>ti.admob</h3>
At the moment Appcelerator is still including the full Goolge Play jar as part of the ti.admob module. As this module is updated it will most likely be split.  You can find the versions of Google Play packaged with the ti.admob module organized by version at  [https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/ti.admob](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Modules/ti.admob)

<h2>By Ti SDK Version</h2>
Hopefully Titanium will package only one version of Google Play Services by version.
Starting with Ti SDK 5.1.0.GA you can find a list of the complete (full) Google Play Service JAR by Ti SDK version at  [https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Ti-SDK](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti-Google-Play-Services/tree/master/Ti-SDK)

<h3>Tools</h3>

If you need to create your own stripped Google Play Service jar I recommend using the bash scripts by [Sebastiano Gottardo](https://gist.github.com/dextorer). He has a great gist [https://gist.github.com/dextorer/a32cad7819b7f272239b](https://gist.github.com/dextorer/a32cad7819b7f272239b])

A version of his script is included in this repo with the on/off configurations used to create the Ti.GA configurations.
